# Sprint Challenge: Theory of Computation and Hash Tables

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint, we explored the history and theory of computation, diving deep into regular expressions, state machines and building array functions and hash tables. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by filling out boolean truth tables and solving algorithms in Python using hash tables.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in Python and your command of the concepts and techniques in the computation theory and hash tables.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your team lead.

## Description

This sprint challenge is divided up into three parts: Boolean algebra (11 points), hash tables (24 points) and a short written response section (20 points). There is also a stretch goal in the boolean algebra section which should only be attempted after the rest of the problems have been completed.

## Written Response

You will be expected to answer the following three questions:

  * 1. What is a regular expression and how does it work?
  * 2. What is an array and how does it work?
  * 3. What is a hash table and how does it work?

Think about how you would answer these questions in an interview. Your answers will receive points at the TL's discretion based on the following criteria:

  * 20: Would love to have this person on my team!
  * 14: Wouldn't mind working with this person.
  * 10: Knowledge is lacking OR poor communication skills (explanation was not as clear as it could have been)
  *  6: Knowledge is lacking AND poor communication skills 
  *  2: You get 2 points for attempting

Please add your responses to [written_responses.md](written_responses.md)

## Project Set Up

#### [Theory of Computation](/theory/README.md)

You can either copy your answers into a new text file or fill out the README with your solutions. Just make sure your TL knows where to find them.

#### [Hash Tables](/hash-tables/README.md)

For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be working through two algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved efficiently using a hash table. Navigate into each exercise's directory, read the instructions for the exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the .py skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the test script with make tests.

A hash table implementation has been included for you already. Your task is to get the tests passing (ideally using a hash table to do it). You can remind yourself of what hash table functions are available by looking at the hashtable.py file that is included in each exercise directory (note that the hash table implementations for both exercises differ slightly).

_You may not use any advanced built-in Python functions to solve these problems._

## Minimum Viable Product

You can earn 20 points from your written responses, 35 points from the main coding portion of the sprint challenge and up to 4 extra points for completing the stretch goal. Stretch points will only be counted if all regular problems have been completed.

#### [Theory of Computation](/theory/README.md) - 11 pts
  * Boolean 1 - 3 pt
  * Boolean 2 - 3 pt
  * Boolean 3 - 5 pt

#### [Hash Tables](/hash-tables/README.md) - 24 pts
  * ex1 - 12 pts
  * ex2 - 12 pts

Both Hash Table problems will be graded as follows:
  *  3: Code attempted
  *  6: Code resembles the correct solution
  * 10: Tests pass
  * 11: Tests pass, no hash table memory leaks
  * 12: Tests pass, no hash table memory leaks, linear runtime complexity  


#### [Computation Stretch](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Sprint-Challenge-Hash-Theory-Python/tree/master/theory) - 4 pts
  * Truth Table - 1 pt
  * Sum - 1 pt
  * Carry - 2 pts
